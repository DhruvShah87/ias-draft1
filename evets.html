          <h4 class="blue-text">Why join IEEE?</h4>
          <p class="black-text">IEEE appeared from the union of two engineering societies in the early sixties, the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) and the AIEE (American Institute of Electrical Engineers). The IEEE is essentially a society for Electrical and Computer Engineers, but it also welcomes Computer Scientists and Physicists. IEEE is what is known as a technical professional society. Every engineering branch has a technical professional society, Civil Engineering has ASCE (American Society of Civil Engineers), Mechanical Engineering has ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).</p>
          <p style="color: black;">What distinguishes IEEE from this other societies is the fact that IEEE is international. There are IEEE chapters in every continent, and in almost every country, and in those countries where IEEE is not established it has links with the local engineering societies, such as the case with IKE (Institution of Electrical Engineers) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This makes IEEE the largest engineering society in the world.</p>

IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter organized a technical hands-on session on Git and Github on 4th April, 2018 in CEP 110, DA-IICT. The speaker of the session was Mr. Khushil Mistry, a third year B.Tech student of DA-IICT. The session witnessed nearly 120 students who displayed great enthusiasm and keenness the whole time. Mr. Khushil Mistry began by giving an introduction to Git and explained its need in the world of collaborative development and research. He emphasized that nearly all multinational companies use this software for effective code development and maintenance. According to him, knowing Git is one of the most sought after industrial skills in the recent times. He introduced students to some of the very basic commands like creating a directory and adding files in it, making commits and listing out all the previous commits. He explained the commands used to save different versions of a file, to revert back to previous versions and to move to a specific version of a file. The students also learnt the code to find difference between versions and to merge various versions. This can be useful when two developers working on the same software want to merge their code into one file. 	
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			Throughout the session, IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter executive committee constantly volunteered in helping the students with their doubts to make sure everyone was on the same page as the speaker. This ensured that the session ran smoothly. It was a proud moment for IEEE IAS DA-IICT Student Branch Chapter to see the students with contentful smiles at the end of the session.

day but due to an overwhelming response from the DA-IICT student community, we
made an arrangement of two slots. A dynamic crowd of 97 students registered for the
Event. The students were explained about the methods and designing aspects of 3D
Printing. Applications such as machine tool manufacturing, space technology, medical field, food technology and so on were explained. One of the enthusiast shared, “The workshop was worth attending as we got to learn about this flourishing technology. A fantastic experience indeed.” Overall, it was a fun-learning, interactive and experience gaining workshop.

                        Instead of visiting some factories and industries whose processes we hardly ever wonder or try to find a far-fetched link applying it in our lives, IAS IEEE Student Branch of DA-IICT thought of visiting something that would provoke students to give a thought to. Punsari village, located 75 km from DA-IICT, awarded 'Best village of Gujarat' and 'Best village of India' in 2010 and 2014 respectively is one such place. 40 students from all four years altogether visited the village.

                        From the story of an underdeveloped village, struggle to make the village not just self-reliant but also smart and a role-model for other towns to the narrative of success, the villagers and sarpanch had a lot to say. We had an interactive session with the Sarpanch where his speech was followed by questions from students and a documentary of the success of village. We then had lunch and short rest. Next, we visited RO system plant. It provides pure water to the whole village and is also capable of generating revenue by selling it to neighboring villages. Embedded with 16 security cameras, 140 loudspeakers across the village and 7 Wi-Fi access points, this village has a functioning system to monitor rule violations and propagate various updates of the policies beneficial to the people. The town has a fantastic plant to generate energy from waste, hence encouraging renewable energy usage. Apart from some advanced requirements like Health care centers, school with computers and digital classrooms, milk bank that has a bus to receive the daily supply from houses, 100% drainage system and washrooms, skill center which has trained 1250 out of 6000 people, zero drop out rate, mobile library, shopping centers and other numerous small facilities which aren't usual in villages this town in its history has made various efforts to change the orthodox mindset of the people. Government has various schemes and policies solely for the benefit of people, there are leaders who actually think of giving something to the society instead of looting it but it is the perspective of the people that hinders their own progress. So, this town arranges awareness camps and sessions for the people so as to acknowledge them with the new technologies and facilities they are provided with and how they are meant for the betterment of the people. One such beautiful series of camp they arranged was - 'Internet and Social media not just for entertainment but also for skill development' which even we, 21st century metropolitan citizens need to learn.

The place has lush green fields, bullock carts, kacha houses, variety of trees and a perfect atmosphere that made our one-day trip fantastic. We came back with light memories and an introspection that was long-lasting.

                        IEEE IAS SB chapter DA-IICT organized a talk on ‘Where Engineering leads?’on 1st April 2016 at 5 pm in conference room, CEP. Mr.Hakimuddin Ali - Managing Director and BU Head - India, South Africa and Middle East, Caldreys Refractories Ltd. was the speaker for the evening. He was accompanied by Prof. Anil Roy, Mentor IEEE IAS DA-IICT and Mr. Gaurang Shah who supported IAS in organising the talk. A welcome speech was given by Jay Shah. The main aim of the talk was an attempt to communicate the difference between the engineering studied during academia and the engineering in the real world Industry or in the other words the Industrial requirements of an engineering student.
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>
                        The speaker emphasized on three major points - the need of quality experience to tackle the real world problems, having ‘EQ higher than average IQ’  and the third being ‘Invest in yourself’. The points were beautifully explained by correlating them with his real life experiences. He emphasized on how at times, not the number of years of your experience, but the variety and increment in the knowledge is what actually counts in the real industrial world. Also the industrial application of the knowledge gained during graduation comes through practical experiences. EQ (Emotional Quotient) is what overrules our IQ (Intelligence Quotient) when it comes to handling of real life problems. He also introduced us to ‘Negative Scripting’. In this world where we hear ‘No’ and ‘Don’t Do’, he advised us to come out of it and do what you decide to, not listening to the negative storytellers.

                      <p>
                        The session ended with a few questions by our future engineers which he answered tactfully with his experience and knowledge. One of the major point in the discussion was that the journey of our corporate life depends on our choice at the opportunity we are provided. No choice is right or wrong, it all depends on the kind of path you want to trail on. Also one question that should be reflected upon - “What should be our aim in Engineering?” Learning and making the best out of the time we get here should be our motto.

                        Around 50 students attended the session. A vote of thanks to the chief guest was given by Prof. Anil Roy and mementos were presented to the chief guest, Mr. Hakimuddin Ali and Mr. Gaurang Shah. Everyone enjoyed light moments at the high tea after the event and were left with the lingering thoughts of the talk.

              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>IAS IEEE Student Branch of DA-IICT had organized a visit to Punsari village, located 75 km from DA-IICT, awarded 'Best village of Gujarat' and 'Best village of India' in 2010 and 2014 respectively is one such place. 40 students from all four years altogether visited the village. An interactive session with the Sarpanch was held where he gave a speech which was followed by questions from students and a documentary of the success of village. Students visited village’s own RO system plant. This town arranges awareness camps and sessions for the people so as to equip them with the new technologies and facilities they are provided with and how they are meant for the betterment of the people. The village isn't inspired from any other village or city, but had its own road-map of development. Also the village has constantly opposed establishing any industry or project that takes away the essence of a village, making people understand the difference between a smart city and a smart village. Students had a fantastic trip and came back with light memories and an introspection that was long-lasting.</span></div>
